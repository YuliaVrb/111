<p>9. Your Statutory Rights</p>
<p>Depending on applicable law, you may have the rights as set out below, which you may exercise by contacting us at support@bitunix.com.</p>
<p>A）Access: you are entitled to ask us if we are processing your information and, if we are, you can request access to your personal data. This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and certain other information about it to check that we are lawfully processing it. We process a large quantity of information, and can thus request that before the information is delivered, you specify the information or processing activities to which your request relates.</p>
<p>B）Correction: you are entitled to request that any incomplete or inaccurate personal data we hold about you is corrected.</p>
<p>C）Erasure: you are entitled to ask us to delete or remove personal data in certain circumstances. There are also certain exceptions where we may refuse a request for erasure, for example, where the personal data is required for compliance with law or in connection with claims.</p>
<p>D）Restriction: you are entitled to ask us to suspend the processing of certain of your personal data about you, for example if you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it.</p>
<p>E）Transfer: you may request the transfer of certain of your personal data to another party.</p>
<p>F）Objection: where we are processing your personal data based on legitimate interests (or those of a third party) you may challenge this. However, we may be entitled to continue processing your information based on our legitimate interests or where this is relevant to legal claims. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes.</p>
<p>If these rights apply, they may however be limited, for example if fulfilling your request would reveal personal data about another person, would infringe the rights of another person or legal entity (including our rights), or if you ask us to delete or change data which we are required by law to keep (or have other compelling legitimate interests in keeping). We will inform you of relevant exemptions we rely upon when responding to any request you make.</p>

This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and certain other information about it to check that we are lawfully processing it. We process a large quantity of information, and can thus request that before the information is delivered, you specify the information or processing activities to which your request relates.\u003C/p>\n\n\u003Cp>B）Correction: you are entitled to request that any incomplete or inaccurate personal data we hold about you is corrected.\u003C/p>\n\n\u003Cp>C）Erasure: you are entitled to ask us to delete or remove personal data in certain circumstances.

You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes.\u003C/p>\n\n\u003Cp>If these rights apply, they may however be limited, for example if fulfilling your request would reveal personal data about another person, would infringe the rights of another person or legal entity (including our rights), or if you ask us to delete or change data which we are required by law to keep (or have other compelling legitimate interests in keeping). We will inform you of relevant exemptions we rely upon when responding to any request you make.\u003C/p>\n\n\u003Cp>10.
