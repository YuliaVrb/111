Bitunix shall not be liable for any loss or damage caused to you or any third party as a result of exercising our rights under this clause.</p>
<p>2. Scope of Service and Your Rights and Obligations</p>
<p>2.1 Bitunix provides you with the service of trading one type of digital asset for another type of digital asset. We do not purchase or sell digital assets directly from or to users as principal. Our services do not provide users with the ability to trade one form of fiat currency for another form of fiat currency.</p>
<p>2.1.1 Users have the right to browse the digital currency real-time market and transaction information on our Platforms, and have the right to submit digital currency trading instructions and complete digital currency trading through our Platforms.</p>
<p>2.1.2 Users have the right to view the information regarding their accounts on our Platforms, and have the right to operate the functions provided by our Platforms.</p>
<p>2.1.3 Users have the right to participate in the website activities organized by our Platforms in accordance with the activity rules published by our Platforms and other services undertaken by our Platforms.</p>
<p>2.2 The user understands and agrees that our Platforms can adjust the service content, service type and service form on the Platforms at any time according to the actual situation at our sole discretion. Our Platforms are not responsible for any negative impact or loss caused to you or any third party due to Platforms adjustments.</p>
<p>2.3 Depending on your country of residence, you may not be able to use all the functions of our Platforms. Without prejudice to our right of suspending certain services to users from a specific country, it is your responsibility to ensure that in accessing our Platforms and services, you are complying with the laws and regulations in your country of residence and/or the country from which you access our Platforms and services.</p>
<p>2.4 In order to access and use our services, you must create an account with Bitunix. You agree to:</p>
<p>（1）provide accurate, current and complete information when creating the account;</p>
<p>（2）maintain and promptly update your account information to keep it accurate, complete, and current;</p>
<p>（3）maintain the security and confidentiality of your login credentials and restrict access to your account and your computer;</p>
<p>（4）promptly notify Bitunix if you discover or otherwise suspect any security breaches related to our Platforms;</p>
<p>（5）take responsibility for all activities that occur under your account and accept all risks of unauthorized access.</p>
<p>2.5 In order to provide services to users, our Platforms may use user&rsquo;s personal information, non-personal information, and information provided by third parties (hereinafter collectively referred to as &quot;user information&quot;). Once the user registers, logs in, and uses our Platforms&rsquo; services, the user will be deemed to fully understand, agree and accept the reasonable use of the user information by the Company including but not limited to collection, statistics and analysis thereof.</p>
<p>2.6 You acknowledge that the status of the transaction confirmed by you on our Platforms in accordance with our Platforms&rsquo; service processes would be an explicit direction for our Platforms to conduct related transactions or operations for you. You agree that our Platforms have the right to deal with related matters in accordance with these Terms and/or relevant documents and rules in accordance with the relevant directions.</p>
<p>2.7 You are responsible for any disputes or losses caused by your failure to promptly modify or confirm the status of the transaction or failure to submit the relevant application. Our Platforms do not assume any responsibility.</p>
<p>3. Risks Disclosures and Acknowledgements</p>
<p>3.1&nbsp;Perpetual Contract Risk Disclosures and Acknowledgements</p>
<p>3.1.1 Digital assets themselves are risky. The price of digital assets is prone to fluctuate, there is no limit for prices to go up and down, and there are unlimited transactions 24 hours a day, 7 days a week worldwide. Prices are easily affected by the control of the dealer and global news events, national policies, market demand and other factors. It may happen that prices rise several times a day, and prices may fall by half in one day. Due to the high leverage of the perpetual contract, you may suffer a large loss, so we strongly recommend that participate in trading within the risk range that you can afford.</p>
<p>3.1.2 Due to unexpected problems such as system failure, network reasons, denial-of-service attacks and other hacking attacks, abnormal transactions, market interruptions, or other possible abnormal conditions, we have the right to cancel the abnormal transaction results and roll back all the deals during a certain period of time according to the actual situation at our sole discretion without any liability whatsoever to you or any third party.</p>
<p>3.1.3 We strictly prohibit any unfair trading practices. We have the right to warn against all unscrupulous behaviors such as maliciously manipulating prices, maliciously affecting trading systems, and, when necessary, to restrict transactions, suspend transactions, cancel transactions, reverse closed transactions, freeze accounts, rollback time transactions, etc., to eliminate adverse effects at our sole discretion without any liability whatsoever to you or any third party.</p>
<p>3.1.4 When your position margin cannot meet the Platform&rsquo;s requirements, your position will be forced to close. If the price fluctuates drastically and loss is incurred after using all risk control methods, we shall have the right to recover the loss from you.</p>
<p>3.1.5 When the number of positions or the number of orders is too large and we believe that there may be serious risks to the system and other users, you understand and agree that we have the right to ask you to take measures such as cancellation, closing and other risk control measures. In addition, when we deem it necessary, we have the right to control the risk of individual accounts by limiting the total number of positions, limiting the total number of orders, limiting the opening of positions, withdrawing orders or forcibly closing positions at our sole discretion without any liability whatsoever to you or any third party.</p>
<p>4. Transaction &amp; Fees</p>
<p>4.1 Our Platforms will provide services for your transactions, and collect necessary services or management fees, in accordance with these Terms, relevant documents, agreements and/or relevant rules and instructions on our Platforms during the service process. Please refer to the relevant documents and the rules and descriptions of the relevant pages of our Platforms which are hereby expressly incorporated into these Terms and may be amended from time to time.</p>
<p>4.2 You agree that our Platforms reserve the right to adjust the specific types and amounts of the aforementioned services or management fees from time to time and to make announcements and amendments in accordance with the Terms and related rules, and your continued access to our services constitutes your acceptance to the relevant rules in their latest forms.</p>
<p>5. Modification/Suspension/Termination of Service</p>
<p>5.1 These Terms shall remain in force unless unilaterally terminated by our Platforms or upon your application to terminate these Terms and with the consent of our Platforms. In the event that you violate these Terms, relevant rules, any laws or regulations, or we reasonably suspect that you are involved in illegal or inappropriate conduct in using our services, or at the request of government authorities, our Platforms reserve the right to, at our sole discretion and without any liability whatsoever to you, terminate these Terms, close your account, or restrict your use of our Platforms. However, our termination does not relieve you of your obligations under these Terms or other agreements generated on our Platforms.</p>
<p>5.2 If you find that a third person fraudulently misappropriated or misappropriated your user account and password, or any other circumstances that are not legally authorized, you should immediately notify our Platforms in an effective manner, requesting our Platforms to suspend the related services. All the liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses arising from or in connection with use of your account, whether authorized or unauthorized, shall be borne by you.</p>
<p>5.3 In view of the particularity of the network service, you agree that our Platforms have the right to change, discontinue or terminate some or all of the network services at any time without prior notification nor any liability whatsoever to you or any third party.</p>
<p>5.4 You understand that our Platforms need to be repaired or maintained on a platform that provides network services (such as Internet sites, mobile networks, etc.) or related equipment on a regular or irregular basis. If such a situation causes the network service to be interrupted within a reasonable period of time, our Platforms shall provide notice as soon as practicable but shall not be responsible for any loss, damage, claim or liability otherwise arising therefrom.</p>
<p>5.5 Our Platforms have the right to stop, suspend or terminate all or part of the services under these Terms without notice, to take any mitigation or interlocutory measures (including without limitation to canceling or reversing transactions and freezing accounts), and to remove or delete the registration data, at our sole discretion without any liability whatsoever to you or any third party. Without prejudice to the generality of the above, we may seek to enforce our right in the following scenarios:</p>
<p>（1）Our Platforms believe that the personal data you provide is not authentic, valid or complete;</p>
<p>（2）Our Platforms discover or suspect an abnormal or illegal transaction or unusual activities on your part;</p>
<p>（3）Our Platforms consider that your account is suspected of money laundering, cashing, pyramid schemes, fraudulent use or other situations that our Platforms consider to be risky;</p>
<p>（4）Our Platforms believe that you have violated these Terms;</p>
<p>（5）If you use the fee-based network service, you do not pay the corresponding service fee to our Platforms as required;</p>

The price of digital assets is prone to fluctuate, there is no limit for prices to go up and down, and there are unlimited transactions 24 hours a day, 7 days a week worldwide. Prices are easily affected by the control of the dealer and global news events, national policies, market demand and other factors. It may happen that prices rise several times a day, and prices may fall by half in one day. Due to the high leverage of the perpetual contract, you may suffer a large loss, so we strongly recommend that participate in trading within the risk range that you can afford.\u003C/p>\n\n\u003Cp>3.1.2 Due to unexpected problems such as system failure, network reasons, denial-of-service attacks and other hacking attacks, abnormal transactions, market interruptions, or other possible abnormal conditions, we have the right to cancel the abnormal transaction results and roll back all the deals during a certain period of time according to the actual situation at our sole discretion without any liability whatsoever to you or any third party.\u003C/p>\n\n\u003Cp>3.1.3 We strictly prohibit any unfair trading practices. We have the right to warn against all unscrupulous behaviors such as maliciously manipulating prices, maliciously affecting trading systems, and, when necessary, to restrict transactions, suspend transactions, cancel transactions, reverse closed transactions, freeze accounts, rollback time transactions, etc., to eliminate adverse effects at our sole discretion without any liability whatsoever to you or any third party.\u003C/p>\n\n\u003Cp>3.1.4 When your position margin cannot meet the Platform&rsquo;s requirements, your position will be forced to close. If the price fluctuates drastically and loss is incurred after using all risk control methods, we shall have the right to recover the loss from you.\u003C/p>\n\n\u003Cp>3.1.5 When the number of positions or the number of orders is too large and we believe that there may be serious risks to the system and other users, you understand and agree that we have the right to ask you to take measures such as cancellation, closing and other risk control measures. In addition, when we deem it necessary, we have the right to control the risk of individual accounts by limiting the total number of positions, limiting the total number of orders, limiting the opening of positions, withdrawing orders or forcibly closing positions at our sole discretion without any liability whatsoever to you or any third party.\u003C/p>\n\n\u003Cp>4.

However, our termination does not relieve you of your obligations under these Terms or other agreements generated on our Platforms.\u003C/p>\n\n\u003Cp>5.2 If you find that a third person fraudulently misappropriated or misappropriated your user account and password, or any other circumstances that are not legally authorized, you should immediately notify our Platforms in an effective manner, requesting our Platforms to suspend the related services. All the liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses arising from or in connection with use of your account, whether authorized or unauthorized, shall be borne by you.\u003C/p>\n\n\u003Cp>5.3 In view of the particularity of the network service, you agree that our Platforms have the right to change, discontinue or terminate some or all of the network services at any time without prior notification nor any liability whatsoever to you or any third party.\u003C/p>\n\n\u003Cp>5.4 You understand that our Platforms need to be repaired or maintained on a platform that provides network services (such as Internet sites, mobile networks, etc.) or related equipment on a regular or irregular basis.
